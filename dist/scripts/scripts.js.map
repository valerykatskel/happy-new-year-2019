Chater, Artlogic Media Ltd, http://www.artlogic.net/\n * Dual licensed under the MIT or GPL Version 2 licenses.\n *\n * Change history:\n * Version 0.4\n *   - add up/down for 'pan' method. <ricky.hewitt@artlogic.net>\n *   - added 'dir' option for Sprites. This means a Sprite can be played in reverse. <michel.gotta@4wdmedia.de>\n *   - removed alert message regarding jQuery.draggable (now uses console.log, if available) <ricky.hewitt@artlogic.net>\n * Version 0.3b\n *   - added lockTo method for locking sprites to background images. $('#sprite').lockTo('#background, {'left': 380, 'top': -60, 'bg_img_width': 1110});\n * Version 0.2.1\n *   - animate function will stop cycling after play_frames has completed\n * Version 0.2 beta\n *   - added isDraggable method (requires jquery-ui) $('#sprite').sprite().isDraggable({start: null, stop: function() {alert('Ouch! You dropped me!')});\n *   - sprites may be set to play a limited number of frames when instantiated, e.g. $('#sprite').sprite({fps: 9, no_of_frames: 3, play_frames: 30})\n *   - sprite speed may be controlled at any point by setting the frames-per-second $('#sprite').fps(20);\n *   - sprites with multiple rows of frames may have there 'state' changed, e.g. to make the second row of frames\n *     active, use: $('#sprite').spState(2); - to return to the first row, use $('#sprite').spState(1);\n *   - background element speed may be controlled at any point with .spSpeed(), e.g. $('#bg1').spSpeed(10)\n *   - background elements may be set to a depth where 100 is the viewer (up close) and 0 is the horizon, e.g.:\n *     $('#bg1').pan({fps: 30, speed: 2, dir: 'left', depth: 30});\n *     $('#bg2').pan({fps: 30, speed: 3, dir: 'left', depth: 70});\n *     relative speed of backgrounds may now be set in a single action with $('#bg1, #bg2').spRelSpeed(20);\n *     which will make elements closer to the horizon (lower depths) move slower than closer elements (higher depths)\n */\n\n(function($) {\n\t$._spritely = {\n\t\t// shared methods and variables used by spritely plugin\n\t\tanimate: function(options) {\n\t\t\tvar el = $(options.el);\n\t\t\tvar el_id = el.attr('id');\n\t\t\toptions = $.extend(options, $._spritely.instances[el_id] || {});\n\t\t\tif (options.play_frames && !$._spritely.instances[el_id]['remaining_frames']) {\n\t\t\t\t$._spritely.instances[el_id]['remaining_frames'] = options.play_frames + 1;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tif (options.type == 'sprite' && options.fps) {\n\t\t\t\tvar frames;\n\t\t\t\tvar animate = function(el) {\n\t\t\t\t\tvar w = options.width, h = options.height;\n\t\t\t\t\tif (!frames) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tframes = [];\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotal = 0\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var i = 0;
